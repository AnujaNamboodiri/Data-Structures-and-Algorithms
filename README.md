## ARRAYS

### Problem 1:
Linear search to look for the presence of an element and its index

### Problem 2:
Binary search to look for the presence of an element and its index in the given array using recursive approach

### Probelm 3:
Binary search to look for the presence of an element and its index inthe given array using iterative approach

# Problem 4: 
LeetCode Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, 
and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

## Binary Search LeetCode:

### Problem 1:

and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

# Problem 2:
 Leet Code We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.
